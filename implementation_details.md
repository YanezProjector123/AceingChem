# Implementation Details Update: MassToMassActivity Custom CSS

## Summary
A new file, `MassToMassActivity.css`, was created to provide a unique, modern, and glassmorphism-inspired visual style exclusively for the Mass-to-Mass activity. This CSS is imported only in `MassToMassActivity.js` and overrides the default look for this activity, making it more visually engaging and distinct from other activities.

## Key Features
- Vibrant gradient background
- Enhanced card layout with glassmorphism and border glow
- Modern, bold typography for the activity title
- Polished inputs, buttons, and feedback containers with interactive effects
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Subtle animations for card and feedback appearance

## Integration
- The CSS file is imported at the top of `MassToMassActivity.js`.
- No changes were made to the logic or structure of the React component.

## Rationale
This approach ensures that only the Mass-to-Mass activity receives the new aesthetic, preserving the appearance and functionality of other activities. The use of a dedicated CSS file supports modularity, maintainability, and easier future updates.

# Implementation Details Update: TheoreticalPercentYieldActivity Integration

## Summary
The `TheoreticalPercentYieldActivity` was integrated into the app as a selectable activity under the Stoichiometry section in `Topics.js`. The button labeled "Theoretical & Percent Yield" now triggers this activity, which is rendered and managed by `App.js`.

## Key Features
- The Stoichiometry section in `Topics.js` includes a button for "Theoretical & Percent Yield".
- Clicking the button triggers `onPeriodicActivity('theoretical-percent-yield')`, which updates the main app state to show the activity.
- The `App.js` render logic for 'theoretical-percent-yield' displays the `TheoreticalPercentYieldActivity` component and passes the required props for navigation, periodic table, and state persistence.
- State for the activity is saved and restored using `savedState` and `setSavedState` props, ensuring user progress is maintained.

## Integration
- The Topics.js button dispatches the correct activity key (`theoretical-percent-yield`) to the app state.
- App.js listens for this state and renders the activity with all required props.
- No changes were made to other activities or unrelated state logic.

## Rationale
This approach maintains a modular and scalable architecture, allowing new activities to be added with minimal changes to the main routing/state logic. The naming convention for activity keys is now consistent (kebab-case), reducing confusion and improving maintainability.

# Bug Fix: TheoreticalPercentYieldActivity Routing Key Mismatch

## Issue
When clicking the "Theoretical & Percent Yield" button, the app navigated to the Welcome page instead of the activity. This was due to a mismatch in the routing key: `handlePeriodicActivity` used `'theoreticalPercentYieldActivity'` (camelCase), but `renderScreen` expected `'theoretical-percent-yield'` (kebab-case).

## Solution
The `handlePeriodicActivity` function was updated to use `'theoretical-percent-yield'` as the screen key, matching the key used in `renderScreen`.

## Prevention
- Always use consistent, documented keys for activity routing.
- Prefer kebab-case for new activity keys for clarity and consistency.
